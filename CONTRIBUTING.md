## Contribution Submission Guidelines

MQTT.org website is focused on being a useful resource to developers and architects who are interested in learning about MQTT. 
The goal of the site is to provide focused content that makes it easy for users to find additional resources in the community. 
For this reason we plan to keep the site content simple and focused.

Therefore, we are only accepting community submissions to the __Software__ and __Use Cases__ pages. 
If you would like to submit content for either of these pages please submit a pull request with the suggested content and follow these guidelines. 

1. Submissions to the Software page must be available MQTT based products. 
Please submit a product to just one category and follow the format for each category.

2. For Use Case submissions, the use case must reference an organization using MQTT to solve a problem. 
Use Cases should not be MQTT product descriptions or MQTT product solution briefs.
