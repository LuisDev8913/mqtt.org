   <h2>Why MQTT?</h2> 
   <section id="keyfeature-list">
   <div class="keyfeature">
      <h3>Lightweight and Efficient</h3>
      <p>MQTT clients are very small, require minimal resources so can be used on small microcontrollers. MQTT message headers are small to optimize network bandwidth.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="keyfeature mid">
      <h3>Bi-directional Communications</h3>
      <p>MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="keyfeature last">
      <h3>Scale to Millions of Things</h3>
      <p>MQTT can scale to connect with millions of IoT devices.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="keyfeature">
      <h3>Reliable Message Delivery</h3>
      <p>Reliability of message delivery is important for many IoT use cases. This is why MQTT has 3 defined quality of service levels: 0 - at most once, 1- at least once, 2 - exactly once
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="keyfeature mid">
      <h3>Support for Unreliable Networks</h3>
      <p>Many IoT devices connect over unreliable cellular networks. MQTTâ€™s support for persistent sessions reduces the time to reconnect the client with the broker.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="keyfeature last">
      <h3>Security Enabled<br/>&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>MQTT makes it easy to encrypt messages using TLS and authenticate clients using modern authentication protocols, such as OAuth.
      </p>
